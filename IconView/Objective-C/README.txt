Here is some example code which illustrates how to use certain features of the
NSCollectionView object, which is available in 10.5 and upwards.

At the moment, the points this illustrates are:

* selecting one or multiple NSView subviews of the NSCollectionView and drawing 
  the view to indicate selection

* registering a double-click event

* resizing the item views within the collection view, and having the collection
  view re-arrange the item views

It may be that NSMatrix is a better fit for what you need to do, so don't
forget to look at that as well.

Code within this project is in the public domain.
